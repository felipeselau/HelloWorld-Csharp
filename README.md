# HelloWorld-Csharp
First C# repository and my first ever code in C#
nothing really complicated, just a "hello world" that asks your name and age,
saves your keyboard inputs as variables and with the help of some "if"s,
does some concatenation to output some custom phrases.

see /HelloWorld/Program.cs for code :)
